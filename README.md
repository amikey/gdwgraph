# gdwgraph

Old pascal sources for VGA-13 screen re-made for SDL/OpenGL
This is cross-compiling sources for Free Pascal (http://www.freepascal.org/) Delphi dialect.

See README.compile in src folder for further instructions on building sources.

See REAME-*.txt files in data folder for brief description on each project.

gdwgraph includes 2 classic games MAN & PITON.

You can download full archive with executables for Windows and Linux using this link:

Note that Linux executables should be rebuilt from sources in most cases.

Some neat screenshots of VGA13 graphics (window 320x200 multiplied by 2, e.g. in gdwgraph programs it is 640*480, each pixel is doubled by OpenGL means). VGA13 has 256 color set and is just wonderful. Wolfenstein3D (tm) by id Software uses it!
